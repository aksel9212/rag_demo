Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd them below using the same format:"

They contain information about the problem's current state, such as \"new,\" \"in work,\" or \"completed,\" and outline the next steps required for resolution. Users can create tickets through two primary methods: the client dashboard or via email.\n\nThe AI Chatbot plays a key role in the ticket management process by classifying the problem described in the ticket and suggesting potential solutions. It can also trigger automated actions like sending status emails. If the AI Chatbot cannot resolve the issue, it can forward the ticket to the appropriate expert support staff for further assistance. Expert support staff utilize the SP site to access, manage, comment on, and close user tickets. Note that tickets must be explicitly \"shared\" for expert support staff to gain access.\n\nReferences:\n* [KG] AI ticket system, Prototype spec.pdf (page 1)\n",
